# Currently Playing Movies

This is the third project for the [@ThisIsMetis](https://github.com/thisismetis) UX &amp; Front-End Development Fall 2014 Bootcamp.

## Project Overview

How can we simplify the process of finding movies currently playing in local theaters in a large, desktop screen experience?

* **Sketch** the critical user flow.
* **Wireframe** each step of the flow.
* **Design** each step of the flow in [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/ "Sketch 3 by Bohemian Coding").
* **Prototype** each step of the flow in [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com/ "Web &amp; Mobile Prototyping Tool").

## Results

All deliverables have been uploaded to to the repository. The [Invision Prototype](http://invis.io/V71ID1PQP) can be found [here](http://invis.io/V71ID1PQP).
